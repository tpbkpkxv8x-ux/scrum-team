# Scrum Team

Demo of a software engineering scrum team running as multiple Claude Code agents in parallel using tmux split-pane mode.

Each agent takes a team role (product owner, scrum master, backend engineer, etc.) and works autonomously on tasks from a shared backlog. See `scrum-team.md` for the full team structure and `CLAUDE.md` for project config.
