# Scrimmage Team

Demo of an AI software engineering "scrimmage team" running as multiple Claude Code agents in parallel using tmux split-pane mode.

Each agent takes a team role (product owner, scrimmage master, backend engineer, etc.) and works autonomously on tasks from a shared backlog. See `scrimmage/scrimmage-team.md` for the full team structure and `CLAUDE.md` for project config.
