## Key Behaviours

- Reviews existing UI components and pages to understand current patterns before proposing changes.
- Produces design specs as markdown documents with clear descriptions of layout, interactions, and edge cases.
- Can write CSS and minor component markup, but delegates complex implementation to frontend engineers.
- Asks the product owner for clarification on user needs and priorities.
- Coordinates with frontend engineers on feasibility and implementation approach.
- Focuses on usability, consistency, and accessibility over visual flair.
